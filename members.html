My science interests include, but not limited to, masers in Galactic star-forming region, astrometry, radio galaxies, Galaxy Clusters, FRBs, and high fidelity imaging with sensitive radio interferometers (ALMA, VLA, MeerKAT) and VLBI. I currently chair the Science Committee of the African Astronomical Society (AfAS), and I am a member of the Users Committee of South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN)steering committee member. I supervise and co-supervise dozens of MSc and PhD students in South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Taiwan, Japan, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Besides astronomy, I love to play soccer and play with my wife and kids.<br>

I am also interested in reverberation mapping studies of quasars. I am involved in a study to improve the teaching of astronomy to the public and potentially extend that to teachers. This will hopefully improve the appreciation that the general public has of the investment the government has made into astronomy.<br>

                                    <p> I got my PhD in Astronomy from UCT in 1990 on the topic of "Atomic Processes in Nova Shells".  From 1990 - 1998 I worked at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) where I was part of the spectroscopy group doing observations mainly on excited OH masers. In Feb 1998 I moved to Unisa where I was head of the astronomy section of the Dept of Mathematics until I retired at the end of 2019. I am still involved with colleagues doing research on modelling of nebular gases, massers in star-forming regions and W UMa contact binary stars. In my spare time, I spend time in game reserves photographing animals and birds, and then a lot more time editing the digital photos.<br>

As a member of the IAU, URSI, and AfAS, my research focuses on star formation, with a particular emphasis on massive stars using Maser emission. I also investigate stellar variability, particularly in eclipsing binaries. Beyond academia, I am passionate about science communication and engaging the public with scientific discoveries.

My major research interest is star formation, especially massive star formation. The main aim of my research is to better understand the earliest evolutionary phase of high-mass star formation, using multiwavelength data, such as VLA, MeerKAT, ALMA, IRAC and Spitzer data, with primary objective of characterizing the chemical, physical and kinematic conditions of ongoing massive star formation. My other science interests include, but not limited to, masers, astrometry and cosmic rays. Presently, I am a Lecturer in the Department of Science Laboratory Technology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka and a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, University of South Africa. I am working on some of the ALMA cores in other to pin down the initial conditions of ongoing massive star formation and assist in supervising students. I love listening to music, watching movies and catching funs with my family and friends.<br>

                                    <p>My research interest is in massive young stellar objects (YSOs) and radio astronomy. Studying massive YSOs can provide valuable insights into the early stages of star formation and the evolution of stellar systems. Radio astronomy helps to observe the cold, dense regions where these objects form, as well as the energetic processes associated with their birth and early development. Exploring the radio emission from massive YSOs can help unravel the complex physical processes involved in their formation, accretion, and interaction with their surroundings. It's an exciting area of research with potential implications for our understanding of star formation, the evolution of galaxies, and the formation of planetary systems. <br>

                                    <p> My name is Andrea Nel and I am an MSc student in the field of radio astronomy at North-West University. I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and have dedicated my academic pursuits to the field of radio astronomy. My research interests include methanol masers, star formation, and star forming regions. After completing my degree, I hope to further my education by pursuing a PhD in astrophysics and astronomy.<br> -->

                                    <p> I'm Andrews, a Ghanaian and a Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) fellow. My current research focuses on studying masers and star formation in the Orion star-forming region. My research interests encompass the behaviour of interstellar masers - particularly water and methanol masers in the context of intermediate and high-mass star formation as well as the intriguing phenomenon of accretion bursts. Additionally, I am interested in big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. With previous experience working at the Ghana Radio Astronomy Observatory, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills in observational astronomy and astrophysics. When I don't have my `head in the clouds’, you can find me backpacking or enjoying a good movie.<br>
